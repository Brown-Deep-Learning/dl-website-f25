# dl-website-f25

Hey team, this is just the general idea that we have for the website. This years theme is **DEEP EARTH**. The motivation behind it is as we get deeper in the course, we get deeper into the Earth. The website will parallel this by changing the background as you scroll deeper on the website. I don't know what the exact layers of the Earth we want are, but I do know Eric wants us to end on mole people üêÄ. 

Now, obviously, we want to prioritize functionality over aesthetics, but the website should look good so it's fun for the students. The general functionality of the website is
- General Course Overview/Description
- Syllabus and General Information/Links
- Most Recent Assignment and Most Recent Lecture
- Lecture List (there should be an easy way to upload lecture files (either a `data.ts` like we did last year or just search the `slides` folder, but may be weird with ordering)
- Assignment List (easy way to upload and link to both programming and conceptual with proper rendering)
- Course Calendar (maybe also a progress bar to track how far we are in the course)
- Resources/General CS links we need to have
- Course Staff (Pictures and make it on theme üëº)
- Make sure the website is dyanmic for both big screen and mobile users :) 
- DO NOT WORRY ABOUT FINAL PROJECT SECTION

  Last year's website: [Website](https://deep-learning-s25.vercel.app/)
  
  Last year's Github: [Repo](https://github.com/Brown-Deep-Learning/dl-website-s25/tree/updated-s25-website) (make sure you are on the `updated-s25-website` branch)
  

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
